## Installing dfu-util

`dfu-util` is currently required to flash Flipper Zero firmware via USB-C port.

You can skip this part if you have `dfu-util` installed.

### Windows

#### Preperation

To flash Flipper in Windows we need `DfuSeDemo` software and firmware in `*.dfu` format. 

Download actual firmware [here](https://update.flipperzero.one/master/firmware/firmware.dfu).
You can get DfuSeDemo from official [site](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-stm32080.html).
It’s completely free, you just need to register during downloading process.

#### Flashing

On Flipper enter in DFU mode and connect to PC.
As you can see our Flipper One named as `DFU in FS Mode` and wee need to install compatible driver.

### Enter DFU Mode

DFU means Device Firmware Update.

{{ gif("/assets/how-to-dfu.mp4") }}

To enter DFU Mode:

1. Press and hold :flp-btn-left: + :flp-btn-back:, just like for reboot, then wait a second
2. Release :flp-btn-back:, but keep holding :flp-btn-left: for one more second
3. Release :flp-btn-left:

The display should turn off, and the LED lights up in blue color, meaning you are in DFU Mode.

Connect your Flipper Zero to the PC over USB.

### Upload firmware

Run this command in the terminal to upload new firmware:
``` sh
dfu-util -a 0 -s 0x08000000 -D full_firmware_latest.bin
```

!!! warning
    If you download the firmware from the link above, you will get a bundled binary, which consists of bootloader and firmware itself.

    However, if you're trying to flash the firmware **without bootloader**, you must use `0x08008000` in `-s` parameter of `dfu-util`. You don't need this normally.

### Boot back

After flashing the firmware, [reboot](rebooting.md) to exit DFU mode.

The USB cable can be unplugged before or after rebooting.
